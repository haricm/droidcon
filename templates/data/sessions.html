I have been running the company since last 13 years.<br>\nMy personal accomplishments:<br>\n1) Codeproject Android Tutorial Contest Runners UP<br>\n2) Codeproject IoT Tutorial Contest Winner<br>\n3) Intel Perceptual Computing Phase I challenge, 3 second prizes<br>\n4) Intel Perceptual Challenge Phase II, 2 Pioneer Award<br>\n5) Intel Real Sense Challenge Trailblazer<br>\n6) Intel Embedded India Contest 2014 finalist<br>\n7) Renesas 2015 Embedded Design Challenge Finalist ( Ongoing)<br>\n8) Intel Ultrabook App Contest Finalist<br>\n9) Intel AppInnovation Contest 2013 Finalist ( + Best proposal in Retail)<br>\n10)Conducted over 30 Hands on  Workshops in over 20 Colleges in various technologies<br>\n11) Intel Software Innovator<br>\n12) My Youtube Channel should speak volume of my work:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/rupam800418\">https://www.youtube.com/user/rupam800418</a></p>'
      , 'objective'   : '<p>The objective of the session would be to walk through developers with Nitty Gritty of Android in Internet of Things. Internet of things integrates smart devices to cloud. Mobiles are preferred medium of Data visualization, notification and controlling. Android provides great deal of sensor support along with APIs for easy cloud integration. Therefore I would want to introduce architecture of IoT with Android with Intel Edison boards. How one can perform Home Automation, Survielance, Biometric, Sensor data analytics and beyond with Android would be aspects that I want to cover.<br>\nAt the end of workshop, attendees must be able to get started with IoT with Android and should be able to design Control, Messaging, Data visualization with Android. I would particularly focus on open source technologies like MQTT, Java Scripts, Node Red, Web Services and Bluetooth.</p>'
      , 'blurb'       : '<p>The session would have following Subtopics<br>\n1) Brief Introduction of IoT and how Android can play an important role in it<br>\n2) Communication between Smart ioT device and Android<br>\n               a) Fog Computing\n               b) MQTT\n               c) NoSql<br>3) Mini Project on Home Automation ( Controlling Light with Android)<br>\n4) Mini Project on Data Visualization ( Viewing Temperature Sensor Data in Android Device)<br>\n5) Mini  Project On Alarm ( Flood or Fire Alarm System in Android)<br>\n6) Concluding Remark</p>'
      , 'requirements' : '<p>I should be able to provide 6 hardware Connected IoT devices. Connected with essential peripheral hardware ( Relay, Sensors, WiFi, Bluetooth)</p>\n<p>Attendees can focus on Android side communication ( We call the Client integration). So following devices will be desirable</p>\n<p>1) Android Phone ( 4.0 and Above)<br>\n2) Laptop ( Preferrably 64 bit)<br>\n3) Android Studio </p>'
